# Subnetting-Routing-CN

Objective:
This project is the final assignment in the Computer Network course, focusing on subnetting for a three-floor network setup at Bina Nusantara University. It also involved routing and configuring the application layer.

My Role:
I was responsible for performing subnetting for 7th floor in the building, ensuring proper network segmentation and configuration for efficient data flow.

Impact:
I contributed to the design and implementation of a robust network system that supports efficient communication and management across multiple floors, improving overall network performance and security.

What did I learn?
I learned how to effectively implement subnetting for network optimization, understand routing concepts, and manage the application layer to ensure smooth data transmission and connectivity.
